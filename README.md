# UoM COMP90054 AI Planning for Autonomy - Pacman Project AISQUAD
This supposed to be a group project, but finaaly become a personal project. So sad that my Teammates don't want to pay too much effort for this competition. Though being tired it has great fun compete with other teams and we have achieved great results for pre-competition and still not sure about the performance in final competion. Submit code to Github for preserving... Wish i could have time to update and achieve more ideas in the future.
